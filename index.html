<h2>GNU ACM</h2>
<hr class="thin" />

<p>
GNU ACM is a distributed aerial combat simulator that runs on the X
Window System. Players can engage in simultaneous air combat from different
computers. Players fly jet aircraft (something close to either an
F-16C Falcon or a MiG-29 Fulcrum) equipped with radar, heat seeking missiles and cannon.</p>

<p>GNU ACM is a slighty modified version of the original ACM made by
Riley Rainey at WebSimulations.</p>
